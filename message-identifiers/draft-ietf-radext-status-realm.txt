1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension to the Remote Authentication
   Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865], to allow
   participants in a multi-hop RADIUS proxy fabric to check the status
   of a remote RADIUS authentication realm, gain visibility into the
   path that a RADIUS request will take across the RADIUS proxy fabric,
   and mitigate or prevent RADIUS proxy forwarding loops.

   This document defines two new RADIUS Packet Type Codes:

   *  Status-Realm-Request (TBD)

   *  Status-Realm-Response (TBD)

   This document also defines the following RADIUS Attributes:

   *  Status-Realm-Response-Code (TBD)

   *  Max-Hop-Count (TBD)

   *  Server-Identifier (TBD)

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document.  Their
   definitions are included here for consistency and clarity.

   RADIUS Request  A RADIUS Request is the first message in a RADIUS
      message exchange.  RADIUS request message types include: Access-
      Request, Accounting-Request, and Status-Server.  This document
      defines a new RADIUS Request message type: Status-Realm-Request.

   RADIUS Response  A RADIUS Response is any RADIUS message sent in
      reply to a RADIUS Request.  RADIUS reponse message types include:
      Access-Accept, Access-Challenge, Access-Reject, Accounting-
      Response.  This document defines a new RADIUS Response message
      type: Status-Realm-Response.

   RADIUS Instance  A single device or software module that implements
      the RADIUS protocol.

   RADIUS Client  A RADIUS Client is a RADIUS Instance that sends RADIUS
      Request messages and recevies RADIUS Reponse messages in reply.

   RADIUS Server  A RADIUS Server is a RADIUS Instance that receives
      RADIUS Requests and sends RADIUS Response messages in reply.

   Authentication Request  An Authentication Request is sent to
      authenticate a particular user within a particular realm.  The
      user and realm information are typically included in a User-Name
      Attribute [RFC2865] within the Authentication Request.

   Authentication Server  An Authentication Server is a RADIUS Server
      that receives Access-Requests for a given RADIUS Realm, and sends
      Access-Access, Access-Challenge or Access-Reject messages in
      response.  A single Authentication Server may serve more than one
      Authentication Realm.

   Authentication Realm  An Authentication Realm consists of a group of
      users within a single organization that can be authenticated using
      RADIUS.  A single Authentication Realm MAY be served by more than
      one Authentication Server.

   Target Realm  The Target Realm of a RADIUS Request is the RADIUS
      Realm toward which the Request is directed.  The Target Realm is
      typically contained within the "User-Name" attribute of a Request.

   RADIUS Proxy  A RADIUS Proxy receives RADIUS Requests and forwards
      then towards the Target Realm included in the RADIUS Request
      message.  It also receives the corresponding RADIUS Respone
      message and fowards them back towards the RADIUS Client that
      originated the request.  In this context forwarding a RADIUS
      Requst consists of generating a new RADIUS Request containing
      information from the original Request, and sending it to the
      configured next-hop RADIUS server for the Target Realm.
      Forwarding a RADIUS Response consists of sending it to the RADIUS
      Server from which the corresponding Request was received.

   RADIUS Proxy Fabric  A multi-hop group of inter-connected RADIUS
      Servers that Proxy requests among themselves towards a set of
      Target Realms.

   RADIUS Proxy Path  The RADIUS Server Path is a the set of RADIUS
      Servers that a RADIUS Request traverses from the first RADIUS
      Server that is contacted by the RADIUS Client to the final RADIUS
      Server that responds to the Request.

   Proxy Loop  A Proxy Loop may occur when two or more RADIUS Proxies
      are configured such that a RADIUS Request follow a circular path
      through the Proxy Fabric, never reaching the Target Realm.  This
      is a pathological and potentially damaging misconfiguration.

   First-Hop Server  The First-Hop Server is the first RADIUS Server
      within a Proxy Fabric to recieve a RADIUS Request.  In some cases,
      the First-Hop RADIUS Server may receive the request from a
      separate RADIUS Client.  In other case, the First-Hop RADIUS
      Server and the RADIUS Client may be running in a single RADIUS
      Instance.

   Last-Hop Proxy  The Last-Hop Proxy is the last RADIUS Proxy to
      forward a RADIUS Request before it reaches the Authentication
      Server.  Depending on its configuraiton, the Last-Hop Proxy may or
      may not know that is the Last-Hop Proxy for a given RADIUS
      Request.

   Note: It is possible for a single RADIUS Instance to serve in
   multiple roles.  For example, it is common for a RADIUS Server to act
   as an Authentication Server for some Realms, while acting as a Proxy
   for other Realms.  A RADIUS Proxy will, by its nature, act as a
   RADIUS Server for some RADIUS messages while acting as a RADIUS
   Client for others.  The requirements in this document apply to all
   RADIUS Instances whenever they are acting in the role to which the
   requirement applies.

4.  Overview

   This document defines two functional extensions to RADIUS: Querying
   the status of a remote RADIUS Realm (Status-Realm), and mitigating,
   detecting and preventing loops in a RADIUS Proxy forwarding loops
   (Proxy Loop Prevention).  This section contains a short overview of
   each function.  Detailed definitions and requirements are covered in
   later sections of this document.

4.1.  Status-Realm Overview

   Status-Realm-Request messages are sent by RADIUS Clients to to query
   the reachability and status of a particular Target Realm.  In some
   cases, the RADIUS Client may be able to reach an Authentication
   Server for the Target Realm directly.  In other cases, the RADIUS
   Client will send the initial Status-Realm request to a RADIUS Proxy,
   which will forward the Status-Realm-Request toward the indicated
   realm.

   Status-Realm-Requests may be sent to the RADIUS authentication port
   or the RADIUS accounting port of the first-hop RADIUS server.  RADIUS
   proxies should forward Status-Realm-Requests received on the
   authentication port to the authentication port of the next-hop RADIUS
   server.  Status-Realm-Requests received on the accounting port
   should, similarly, be forwarded to the accounting port of the next-
   hop server.

   When a Status-Realm-Request packet is received by an RADIUS Server
   for the Target Realm, the RADIUS Server MUST respond with a Status-
   Realm-Response packet.

   If a RADIUS Proxy is unable to forward a Status-Realm-Request packet
   towards the Target Realm, either because it has no information about
   how to reach the Target Realm, or because there are no reachable
   RADIUS Servers for the Target Realm, the RADIUS Proxy MUST return a
   Status-Realm-Response packet containing a Status-Realm-Response-Code
   attribute.

   Status-Realm packets allow the sender to determine the reachability
   and status of a Realm, without requiring a direct RADIUS connection
   to a RADIUS Server for the Target Realm, and without requiring
   credentials for an authorized user within that Realm.  This can be
   useful for debugging RADIUS authentication issues, identifying
   routing issues within a RADIUS proxy fabric, or monitoring realm
   availability.

4.2.  Proxy Chains and Loops

   RADIUS Proxies are configured to know which next-hop RADIUS Server to
   use for a given Target Realm.  There is no dynamic routing protocol
   or tree-spanning protocol in use, so Proxy Loops are a common
   occurence due to misconfiguration.  These loops can be controlled or
   prevented using implementation-specific or operator-specific
   mechanisms, but it would be useful to have well-defined, common
   mechanism.

   The Max-Hop-Count attribute described in this document can be used to
   mitigate the damage caused by Proxy Loops.  The Max-Hop-Count
   attribute is set to a small integer by the RADIUS Client or First-Hop
   RADIUS Server.  The value is decremented each time a RADIUS message
   is proxied.  When the Max-Hop-Count reaches zero, the request is
   discarded, ending the loop.

   RADIUS Clients can also use the Max-Hop-Count attribute to implement
   "traceroute-like" functionality.  By setting the Max-Hop-Count value
   to a series of increasing values, it is possible to discover the
   proxies which route packets to a target realm.  As there is no
   relationship between independent Status-Realm packets, the path (or
   partial path) discovered by one Status-Realm packet is likely to be
   differerent from the path discovered by a different Sgtatus-Realm
   packet.

   This document also defines a more effective method of detecting and
   preventing Proxy Forwarding Loops: RADIUS Loop Prevention.  This
   document defines a RADIUS Server-Identifier attribute that is used to
   uniquely identify a RADIUS Server.  When a RADIUS Proxy receives a
   RADIUS Request packet, it checks to see if the Request contains a
   Server-Identifier attribute indicating that it has already processed
   this packet.  If so, it discards the packet.  If not, it adds its own
   Server Identifier to the packet before forwarding it.

5.  Packet Formats

   This section describes the RADIUS packet formats for Status-Realm-
   Request and Status-Realm-Response packets.  Status-Realm-Requests are
   sent in the same format, whether they are sent to the authentication
   port or the accounting port.

5.1.  Status-Realm-Request Packet

   Status-Realm-Request packets reuse the RADIUS packet format, with the
   fields and values for those fields as defined in [RFC2865],
   Section 3.

   A Status-Realm-Request packet MUST include a Message-Authenticator
   ([RFC2869], section 5.14) as the first attribute in the packet.  The
   Message-Authenticator provides per-packet authentication and
   integrity protection.  The Authenticator field of a Status-Realm-
   Request packet MUST be generated using the same method as that used
   for the Request Authenticator field of Access-Request packets.  As a
   result, all of the security issues for Access-Request also apply to
   Status-Realm-Request.

   A Status-Realm-Request packets MUST include a User-Name attribute
   which the Target Realm for the Request.  The 'user' portion of the
   User-Name SHOULD be ignored, if present.

   A Status-Realm-Request message MUST also include a Max-Hop-Count
   attribute, as defined below.

   Status-Realm-Request messages MUST include a RADIUS Identifier, and
   this identifier MUST be tracked separately from identifiers in
   Access-Request RADIUS messages.

   Status-Realm-Requests MAY include NAS-Identifier, and one of (NAS-IP-
   Address or NAS-IPv6-Address).  These attributes are not necessary for
   the operation of Status-Realm, but may be useful information to a
   server that receives those packets.

   Status-Realm-Request packets MUST NOT contain authentication
   credentials (such as User-Password, CHAP-Password, EAP-Message) or
   User or NAS accounting attributes (such as Acct-Session-Id, Acct-
   Status-Type, Acct-Input-Octets).  When a RADIUS Server receives a
   Status-Realm-Request with authentication credentials, it MUST respond
   with a Status-Realm-Response, and that Status-Realm-Response MUST
   contain a Status-Realm-Response-Code Attribute with Response-Code
   503, Invalid Contents, user credential included.

5.2.  Status-Realm-Response Packet

   Status-Realm-Response packets reuse the RADIUS packet format, with
   the fields and values for those fields as defined in [RFC2865],
   Section 3.

   The Response Authenticator field of a Status-Realm-Response packet
   MUST be generated using the same method used for calculating the
   Response Authenticator of an Access-Accept sent in response to an
   Access-Request, with the Status-Realm-Request Request Authenticator
   taking the place of the Access-Request Request Authenticator.

   The Status-Realm-Response packet MUST contain a Status-Realm-
   Response-Code attribute, as defined below, indicating the results of
   the Status-Realm request.

   The Status-Realm-Response packet MAY contain the following
   attributes: Reply-Message, Message-Authenticator, Server-Information.

   When a server responds to a Status-Realm-Request packet, it MUST NOT
   send more than one Status-Realm-Response packet.

6.  Max-Hop-Count Attribute

   This section defines a new RADIUS attribute, Max-Hop-Count (TBD).
   The value of the Max-Hop-Count attribute is an integer, as defined in
   [RFC8044], Section 3.1.  Valid values are small positive integers, 0
   to 255.

   This attribute is used to limit the number of RADIUS Proxy hops that
   a packet will pass through before either it times out, or it reaches
   its final destination.  Before a RADIUS Proxy forwards a Status-
   Realm-Request packet, it MUST check the Max-Hop-Count attribute.  If
   the Max-Hop-Count attribute is present and the value is zero, the
   Request MUST NOT be forwarded and an error response SHOULD be
   returned, as appropriate to the request type.  If the Max-Hop-Count
   is greater than zero, the proxy server MUST decrement the hop count
   by 1 before forwarding the request.

   A RADIUS server which will not proxy the Status-Realm-Request packet
   MUST ignore the value of the Max-Hop-Count attribute.

   In the context of Status-Realm-Requests, this attribute can be used
   to implement "traceroute-like" functionality.  By sending a series of
   Status-Realm-Requests with incremented values of Max-Hop-Count,
   starting with a Max-Hop-Count value of 0, the RADIUS Client will
   receive a series of Status-Realm-Responses from the RADIUS Proxies on
   the Proxy Path to a given Target Realm.

   The Max-Hop-Count attribute can used with other types of RADIUS
   Request messages, in order to mitigate the damage caused by RADIUS
   proxy loops.  It is therefore possible that a RADIUS Client or a
   RADIUS Proxy will support the Max-Hop-Count attribute, even if they
   do not support Status-Realm.  When used to limit RADIUS Proxy loops,
   it is RECOMMENDED that the value of the Max-Hop-Count attribute be
   set to 32, by default.

   For any type of RADIUS request message, setting the Max-Hop-Count
   attribute to 0 effectively requests that the request message not be
   proxied.  Setting the attribute to a value greater than 0 requests
   that the request message be proxied across at most that many
   intermediate proxies between the visited and home server.

   If this attribute is not present on a RADIUS Request received from a
   RADIUS Client, the First-Hop RADIUS Server MAY add this option,
   setting it to the default value of 32, or to any valid, configured
   value.

7.  Status-Realm-Response-Code Attribute

   This section defines a new RADIUS attribute, Status-Realm-Response-
   Code (TBD).  This has data type tlv, as defined in [RFC8044], section
   3.13.  It contains 3 sub-attributes:

   *  Response-Code (Type = 1)

   *  Hop-Count (Type = 2)

   *  Responding-Server (Type = 3)

   Response-Code has data type 'integer', as defined in [RFC8044],
   Section 3.1.  Exactly one Response-Code sub-attribute MUST be
   included in in every Status-Realm-Response-Code attribute.  Response-
   Code values are grouped into one of several ranges:

                     +=========+=====================+
                     | Range   | Meaning             |
                     +=========+=====================+
                     | 200-299 | Successful response |
                     +---------+---------------------+
                     | 300-399 | Status unknown      |
                     +---------+---------------------+
                     | 400-499 | Realm unreachable   |
                     +---------+---------------------+
                     | 500-599 | Server error        |
                     +---------+---------------------+

                                  Table 1

   The Response-Code value will be one of:

   +======+===========================================================+
   | Code | Meaning                                                   |
   +======+===========================================================+
   | 200  | The target realm is available                             |
   +------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 300  | Administratively prohibited, target realm status unknown  |
   +------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 400  | No proxy route to the target realm                        |
   +------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 401  | No available servers for the target realm                 |

   | 502  | Bad Status-Realm-Request, missing or invalid Max-Hop-     |
   |      | Count, target realm status unknown                        |
   +------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 503  | Invalid Contents, user credential included                |
   +------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

                                 Table 2

   Code 200 MUST be returned when the target of the Status-Realm-Request
   is available.

   Code 300 SHOULD be returned when the RADIUS Proxy is configured not
   to forward a Status-Realm-Request packet to the Target Realm and the
   RADIUS Proxy does not have other methods to detect the status of the
   Target Realm.

   Code 400 MUST be returned when the RADIUS Proxy server does not have
   a route to the Target Realm.

   Code 401 SHOULD be returned when the RADISU Server has a direct
   connection to the Target Realm RADIUS Server, is configured not to
   forward Status-Realm-Request packets to the Target Realm RADIUS
   Server, and the RADIUS Server believes that the Target Realm RADIUS
   Server is currently unreachable.  An example of a reason to believe
   that the Target Realm RADIUS Server is unreachable is that the Target
   Realm RADIUS Server has not responded to recent valid RADIUS
   requests.

   Code 402 MUST be returned when a Status-Realm-Request specifies a
   realm with a valid format and the RADIUS Server knows that realm does
   not exist.  For example, consider a RADIUS server is configured to be
   authoritative for all realms ending in ".invalid" that receives a
   request for "example.invalid" but does not have an entry for
   "example.invalid."  This server MUST return code 402.

   Code 403 MUST be returned if the Max-Hop-Count is equal to zero (0).

   Code 500 SHOULD be returned if the RADIUS Server encounters an error
   not detailed in this document.

   Code 501 SHOULD be returned if the Status-Realm-Request contains a
   Target Realm that is invalid.  An example of an invalid Target Realm
   would be "_invalid_", which does not follow the rules for DNS
   hostnames.

   Code 502 SHOULD be returned when the Status-Realm-Request does not
   contain the Max-Hop-Count attribute.

   Code 503 MAY be returned when the Status-Realm-Request contains a
   User-Name attribute that includes a username.  If the RADIUS Server
   instead forwards the Status-Realm-Request to another RADIUS Server,
   then it MUST strip the username part of the credential from the User-
   Name attribute, leaving the Target Realm.

   Hop-Count has data type 'integer'.  Valid values are 0-255.  The
   value of this sub-attribute MUST be set to the value of the Max-Hop-
   Count attribute in the received Status-Realm-Request.  If no Max-Hop-
   Count is included in the Status-Realm-Request message, this sub-
   attribute MUST be omitted.

   Responding-Server has data type 'tlv', as defined in [RFC8044],
   Section 3.13.  This sub-attribute MUST be returned in every Status-
   Realm-Response attribute.  The value field of this sub-attribute
   contains a Server-Information Attribute for the responding server, as
   described below.

8.  Server-Information Attribute

   The Server-Information attribute is used to identify a specific
   RADIUS Server.  A RADIUS Proxy MAY append its own Server-Informatin
   to any RADIUS Request message it proxies, to indicate that it has
   processed the Request.  A RADIUS Server MAY include its own Server-
   Information in any RADIUS Response message that it sends, to indicate
   that it has processed the requyest.  A RADIUS Proxy which receives a
   RADIUS Response message SHOULD include its own Server-Information in
   any RADIUS Response message that it sends.  A RADIUS Proxy which
   receives a Response message containing Server-Information attributes
   SHOULD then append those to any Response message that it sends (i.e.
   after its own Server-Information).  A RADIUS Proxiy MUST NOT modify
   any existing Server-Information attributes in Response messages which
   they receive.

   This attribute has data type 'tlv', as defined in [RFC8044],
   Section 3.13.  The value of this attribute consists of a set of sub-
   attributes, all of type 'tlv'.  Each sub-attribute contains an
   identifier for a RADIUS proxy.  The Server-Identifier MUST have at
   least one sub-attribute and MAY have more than one sub-attribute.  If
   multiple sub-attributes are present, a RADIUS proxy MUST match all of
   the sub-attributes in order to match the identifier.

   The following sub-attributes are defined for the Server-Information
   attribute.

                      +=====================+======+
                      | Name                | Type |
                      +=====================+======+
                      | Server-Operator     | 1    |
                      +---------------------+------+
                      | Server-Identifier   | 2    |
                      +---------------------+------+
                      | Hop-Count           | 3    |
                      +---------------------+------+
                      | Time-Delta          | 4    |
                      +---------------------+------+
                      | Server-IP-Address   | 5    |
                      +---------------------+------+
                      | Server-IPv6-Address | 6    |
                      +---------------------+------+

                                 Table 3

   The Server-Information attribute may include any of Server-Operator,
   Hop-Count, and Time-Delta.  The Server-Information attribute may also
   include any one of Server-Identifier OR Server-IP-Address OR Server-
   IPv6-Address.  The attribute SHOULD NOT include more than one of
   Server-Identifier, Server-IP-Address, and Server-IPv6-Address.

   The Server-Operator has data type 'string'.  It is the analogue of
   the Operator-Name, as defined in [RFC5580].

   The Server-Identifier in an analogue of the NAS-Identifier defined in
   [RFC2865].  It indicates the name of this particular proxy server.
   This field is used to identify which server processed the Request,
   among those operated by the organization indicated in the Server-
   Operator sub-attribute.

   The Time-Delta attribute has data type 'integer'.  It represents the
   number of milliseconds the request took to return through this proxy
   server.  For the target server, this value SHOULD be 0.

   The Server-IP-Address has data type 'ipv4addr' and represents the
   IPv4 address of this particular proxy server.  Similarly, the Server-
   IPv6-Address has data type 'ipv6addr' and represents the IPv6 address
   of this particular proxy server.  Given the prevalance of network
   translation, it will be common for a server to be unaware of its
   commonly used address; therefore, a RADIUS Server SHOULD allow its
   administrator to configure the values used for these attributes.

8.1.  Status-Realm Responding-Server

   This attribute is also included as the sub-attribute Responding-
   Server within the Status-Realm-Response-Code attribute, defined
   above, to indicate which RADIUS Server has sent the Status-Realm-
   Response message.  Thus, a Status-Realm response may contain many
   Server-Information attributes, as well as a Status-Realm-Response-
   Code attribute with the Responding-Server sub-attribute, which has
   the same structure.

   If a Status-Realm request targeting "target-realm" is routed over
   proxy servers P1 and P2 before reaching the "target-realm" home
   server, then the response message will contain these attributes:

   *  Server-Information:

      -  Server-Operator: P1

      -  Server-Identifier: P1

      -  Hop-Count: 32

      -  Time-Delta: 90

   *  Server-Information:

      -  Server-Operator: P2

      -  Server-Identifier: P2-Alpha

      -  Hop-Count: 31

      -  Time-Delta: 60

   *  Status-Realm-Response-Code:

      -  Response-Code: 200 (Available)

      -  Hop-Count: 30

      -  Responding-Server:

         o  Server-Operator: target-realm

         o  Server-Identifier: radius1.target-realm

         o  Hop-Count: 30

         o  Time-Delta: 0

9.  Status-Realm Implementation Requirements

   This section describes implementation details and requirements for
   RADIUS Clients and Servers that support Status-Realm.

9.1.  RADIUS Client Requirements

   When Status-Realm-Request packets are sent from a RADIUS Client, they
   MUST NOT be retransmitted.  Instead, the Identifier field MUST be
   changed every time a packet is transmitted.  The old packet should be
   discarded, and a new Status-Realm-Request packet should be generated
   and sent, with new Identifier and Authenticator fields.

   RADIUS Clients MUST include the Message-Authenticator attribute in
   all Status-Realm-Request packets.  Failure to do so would mean that
   the packets could be trivially spoofed, leading to potential denial-
   of-service (DoS) attacks.

   The RADIUS Client MUST include a User-Name attribute in the request.
   The User-Name attribute MUST be formatted as a Network Access
   Identifier (NAI), as described in RFC 7542.  The NAI SHOULD follow
   the second alternative form, '"@" utf8-realm'.  The "utf8-realm"
   portion of the NAI is the target realm for the Status-Realm request,
   and MUST follow the rules for NAI realms set out in section 2.

   RADIUS Clients that support Status-Realm-Requests SHOULD allow a user
   or administrator to set or configure the Count value of the Max-Hop-
   Count Attribute described above.  If a different value is not
   indicated, the RADIUS Client SHOULD include a Max-Hop-Count attribute
   with a Count value of 32 in the Status-Realm-Request packet to
   prevent the possibility that Status-Realm-Requests will loop
   indefinitely.

   The RADIUS Client MAY increment packet counters as a result of
   sending a Status-Realm-Resquest or receiving a Status-Realm-Response.
   The RADIUS Client MUST NOT perform any other action that is normally
   performed when it receives a Response packet, such as permitting a
   user to have login access to a port.

   RADIUS Clients MAY send Status-Realm-Request packets to the RADIUS
   destination ports from the same source port(s) used to send other
   Request packets.  RADIUS Clients MAY choose to send Status-Realm-
   Request packets from a unique source port that is not used to send
   other Request packets.

   In the case where a RADIUS Client sends a Status-Realm-Request
   packets from a source port also used to send other Request packets,
   the Identifier field MUST be unique across all outstanding Request
   packets for that source port, independent of the value of the RADIUS
   Code field for those outstanding requests.  Once the RADIUS Client
   has either received a corresponding Status-Realm-Response packet or
   determined that the Status-Realm-Request has timed out, it may reuse
   the Identifier in another Request packet.

   The RADIUS Client MUST validate the Response Authenticator in the
   Status-Realm-Response.  If the Response Authenticator is not valid,
   the packet MUST be silently discarded.  If the Response Authenticator
   is valid, then the packet MUST be deemed to be a valid response.

9.2.  Server Requirements

   Servers SHOULD permit administrators to globally enable or disable
   the acceptance of Status-Realm-Request packets.  The default SHOULD
   be that acceptance is enabled.  Servers SHOULD also permit
   administrators to enable or disable acceptance of Status-Realm-
   Request packets on a per-RADIUS Client basis.  The default SHOULD be
   that acceptance is enabled.

   If a server does not support Status-Realm, or if it is configured not
   to respond to Status-Realm-Requests, then it MUST silently discard
   any Status-Realm-Requests messages that it receives.  If a server
   receives a Status-Realm-Request packet from a RADIUS Client from
   which it is configured not to accept Status-Realm-Requests, then it
   MUST silently discard the message.

   If a server supports Status-Realm, is configured to respond to
   Status-Realm-Requets, and receives a Status-Realm-Request packet from
   a permitted RADIUS Client, it MUST first validate the Message-
   Authenticator attribute as defined in [RFC3579], Section 3.2.
   Packets failing this validation MUST be silently discarded.

   If the Status-Realm-Request passes Message-Authenticator validation,
   then the server should check if the Target Realm matches a local
   realm served by this Server.  If it does match, the server should
   send a Status-Realm-Response packet indicating that status of the
   Target Realm, reachable or unreachable (Status-Server-Response-Code =
   0 or 2).

   If the Target Realm does not match a local realm, then the server
   should determine whether it is configured to proxy packets towards
   the Target Realm.  If so, the server should implement the Proxy
   Server Requirements, below.  Servers SHOULD ignore the value of the
   "user" portion of the User-Name attribute, if any.

   Servers SHOULD NOT discard Status-Realm packets merely because they
   have recently sent the RADIUS Client a response packet.  The query
   may have originated from an administrator who does not have access to
   the response packet stream or one who is interested in obtaining
   additional information about the server.

   The server MAY decide to send an error response to a Status-Realm-
   Request packet based on local-site policy.  For example, a server
   that is running but is unable to perform its normal duties SHOULD
   send a Status-Realm-Response packet indicating an internal error
   (Status-Server-Response-Code = 500).  This situation can happen, for
   example, when a server requires access to a database for normal
   operation, but the connection to that database is down.  Or, it may
   happen when the accepted load on the server is lower than the current
   load.

   The server MAY increment packet counters or create log entries as a
   result of receiving a Status-Realm-Request packet or sending a
   Status-Realm-Response packet.  The server SHOULD NOT perform any
   other action that is normally performed when it receives a Request
   packet, other than sending a Response packet.

   If the Status-Realm-Request packet includes a Max-Hop-Count
   attribute, that attribute (with its current value) MUST be returned
   in any corresponding Status-Realm-Response packet.

   Note that [RFC2865], Section 3, defines a number of RADIUS Codes, but
   does not make statements about which Codes are valid for port 1812.
   In contrast, [RFC2866], Section 3, specifies that only RADIUS
   Accounting packets are to be sent to port 1813.  This specification
   is compatible with the standards-track specification [RFC2865], as it
   defines a new Message Type Code for packets to port 1812.  This
   specification is not compatible with the informational document
   [RFC2866], as it adds a new Code (Status-Realm-Request) that is valid
   for port 1813.

9.3.  Proxy Server Requirements

   Many RADIUS servers act as RADIUS proxies, forwarding requests to
   other RADIUS servers.  Such servers SHOULD proxy Status-Realm-Request
   packets to enable RADIUS Clients to determine the status of
   Authentication Realms that are not directly connected to the RADIUS
   Client.

   RADIUS proxies that support Status-Realm-Requests MUST support the
   Max-Hop-Count attribute defined above.  Before forwarding a Status-
   Realm-Request packet, a proxy MUST check the Max-Hop-Count Attribute.
   If the Max-Hop-Count attribute is present and the Count is zero (0),
   the proxy MUST send a Status-Realm-Response indicating that the hop
   count has been exceeded (Status-Server-Response-Code = 403), and MUST
   NOT forward the packet.  If the Max-Hop-Count attribute is present,
   and the Count value is not zero, the proxy MUST decrement the Max-
   Hop-Count value before forwarding the packet.

   The RADIUS proxy MUST check the "realm" portion of the User-Name
   attribute in the Status-Realm-Request to determine the Target Realm
   for the request.  If the target realm is missing or malformed, the
   RADIUS proxy MUST send a Status-Realm-Response indicating an invalid
   realm (Status-Server-Response-Code = 402).  If the realm is properly
   formed, the Status-Realm-Request packet should be proxied toward the
   Target Realm, using the same next-hop RADIUS server that the proxy
   server would use for other request packets received on the same port.

   In some cases, a RADIUS proxy may not have an available next-hop
   RADIUS server for the Target Realm.  In that case, the RADIUS proxy
   server MUST send a Status-Realm-Response packet indicating that there
   is no proxy route to the Target Realm (Status-Server-Response-Code =
   400).

   In cases where a RADIUS proxy is configured to have a direct
   connection to the RADIUS server(s) of the Target Realm, but is
   configured not to forward Status-Realm-Request packets to the target
   server(s), the proxy MAY use other methods to determine the status of
   the Target Realm (such as Status-Server packets or recent Access-
   Request state information), and send a Status-Realm-Response
   indicating the determined state of the Target Realm (Status-Server-
   Response-Code = 200 or 401).  If the proxy is configured not to
   forward Status-Realm-Request packet to the Target Realm and does not
   have other methods to detect the status of the Target Realm, it
   SHOULD return a Status-Realm-Response packet indicating that the
   request is administratively prohibited (Status-Server-Response-Code =
   300).

   If the Status-Realm-Request packet includes a Max-Hop-Count
   attribute, that attribute (with its current value) MUST be returned
   in any corresponding Status-Realm-Response packet.

10.  Status-Realm Implementation Status

   There is an initial implementation of Status-Realm available here:

   https://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/tree/Status-Realm

10.1.  Status-Realm Message Exchange Examples

   Message exchange examples are TBD.

11.  Proxy Loop Detection Implementation Requirements

   This section describes implementation details and requirements for
   RADIUS Clients, Servers and Proxies that support Proxy Loop
   Detection.

11.1.  Server Requirements

   A RADIUS Server that implements Proxy Loop Prevention add its own
   Server-Information Attribute to any RADIUS message that it generates,
   including RADIUS Response messages.  It MUST also copy all Server-
   Information atributes from a received RADIUS Request into any RADIUS
   Response that it generates in reply to that Request.

11.2.  Proxy Requirements

   A RADIUS Proxy that implements the Loop Prevention mechanism defined
   in this document MUST be configured with information to populate a
   Server-Information attribute, and matching criteria to determine if a
   Server-Information attribute in an incoming request indicates the
   existence of a Proxy Loop.

   Before forwarding a RADIUS Request towards the Target Realm, a RADIUS
   Proxy that implements Proxy Loop Prevention MUST examine each of the
   Server-Information attributes included in the Request message to
   determine whether the message is caught in a Proxy Loop.  If so, the
   Proxy should discard the message.  If a Proxy Loop is not detected,
   the RADIUS Proxy MUST add its own Server-Information attribute to any
   RADIUS Request that they forward toward the Target Realm.

12.  Proxy Loop Detection Implementation Status

   The Proxy Loop Detection mechanism is similar to RADIUS Vendor-
   Specific attribute used today to detect RADIUS Proxy Loops.  Unlike
   the Vendor-Specific attributes in use today, this mechanism includes
   server information within a single, globally-defrined attribute,
   rather than requiring that a unique vendor identifiers be allocated
   for each RADIUS Server operator.

12.1.  Loop Detection Message Exchange Examples

   Message exchange examples are TBD.

13.  Management Information Base (MIB) Considerations

   Status-Realm-Request packets are sent to the defined RADIUS ports, so
   they can affect the [RFC4669] and [RFC4671] RADIUS server MIB
   modules.  [RFC4669] defines a counter named
   radiusAuthServTotalUnknownTypes that counts the number of RADIUS
   packets of unknown type that were received.  [RFC4671] defines a
   similar counter named radiusAccServTotalUnknownTypes.
   Implementations not supporting Status-Realm-Requests or
   implementations that are configured not to respond to Status-Realm-
   Request packets MUST use these counters to track received Status-
   Realm packets.

   If, however, Status-Realm-Requests are supported and the server is
   configured to respond as described above, then the counters defined
   in [RFC4669] and [RFC4671] MUST NOT be used to track Status-Realm-
   Request or Status-Realm-Response packets.  That is, when a server
   fully implements Status-Realm, the counters defined in [RFC4669] and
   [RFC4671] MUST be unaffected by the transmission or reception of
   packets relating to Status-Realm-Requests.

   If a server supports Status-Realm-Request and the [RFC4669] or
   [RFC4671] MIB modules, then it SHOULD also support vendor-specific
   MIB extensions dedicated solely to tracking Status-Realm-Request and
   Status-Realm-Response packets.  Any definition of the server MIB
   modules for Status-Realm-Requests is outside of the scope of this
   document.

14.  Interaction with RADIUS Client MIB Modules

   RADIUS Clients implementing Status-Realm-Request MUST NOT increment
   [RFC4668] or [RFC4670] counters upon reception of Status-Realm-
   Response packets.  That is, when a RADIUS Client fully implements
   Status-Realm-Request, the counters defined in [RFC4668] and [RFC4670]
   MUST be unaffected by the transmission or reception of packets
   relating to Status-Realm.

   If an implementation supports Status-Realm-Request and the [RFC4668]
   or [RFC4670] MIB modules, then it SHOULD also support vendor-specific
   MIB extensions dedicated solely to tracking Status-Realm requests and
   responses.  Any definition of the RADIUS Client MIB modules for
   Status-Realm-Requests is outside of the scope of this document.

15.  Status-Realm Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in Status-Realm-Request and Status-Realm-Response packets, and in
   what quantity.  Attributes other than the ones listed below SHOULD
   NOT be found in a Status-Realm-Request packet.

      Status-      Status-
      Realm-       Realm-
      Request      Response

      1            1              1      User-Name
      0            0              2      User-Password
      0            0              3      CHAP-Password
      0-1          0              4      NAS-IP-Address (Note 1)
      0            0+            18      Reply-Message
      0+           0+            26      Vendor-Specific
      0-1          0             32      NAS-Identifier (Note 1)
      0            0             79      EAP-Message
      1            0-1           80      Message-Authenticator
      0-1          0             95      NAS-IPv6-Address (Note 1)
      0            1             (TBD)   Status-Realm-Response-Code
      1            0             (TBD)   Max-Hop-Count
      0+           0+            (TBD)   Server-Information
      0            0             103-121 Digest-*

   Note 1: Status-Realm-Request packet SHOULD contain one of (NAS-IP-
   Address or NAS-IPv6-Address), or NAS-Identifier, or both NAS-
   Identifier and one of (NAS-IP-Address or NAS-IPv6-Address).

   The following table defines the meaning of the table entries included
   above:

      0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
      0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
            the packet.
      0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
            the packet.
      1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in
            the packet.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the Status-Realm-Request (TBD) and the Status-
   Realm-Response (TBD) RADIUS Packet Type Codes, both of which should
   be assigned by IANA from the Unassigned block of RADIUS Packet Type
   Codes.

   This document defines three new RADIUS attributes, Max-Hop-Count
   (TBD) and Status-Realm-Response-Code (TBD) and Server-Identifier
   (TBD), which should be assigned by IANA from an Unassigned block of
   RADIUS Attribute Types, such as the Unassigned block for Extended-
   Attribute-1.

   This document also defines two new Protocol Registries that need to
   be created: "Values for RADIUS Attribute (TBD), Status-Realm-
   Response-Code" and "Valies for RADIUS Attribute (TBD), Server-
   Identifier".  Initial values for these registries are defined above.

17.  Security Considerations

   Status-Realm-Request packets are similar to Access-Request packets,
   and are therefore subject to the same security considerations as
   described in [RFC2865], Section 8.  Status-Realm packets also use the
   Message-Authenticator attribute, and are therefore subject to the
   same security considerations as [RFC3579], Section 4.

   We reiterate that all Status-Realm-Request packets MUST contain a
   Message-Authenticator.  Servers not checking the Message-
   Authenticator attribute could respond to Status-Realm packets from an
   attacker, potentially enabling a reflected DoS attack onto a real
   RADIUS Client.

   Where this document differs from [RFC2865] is that it defines a new
   request/response method in RADIUS: the Status-Realm-Request and
   Status-Realm-Response.  The Status-Realm-Request is similar to the
   previously described and widely implemented Status-Server message
   [RFC5997], and no additional security considerations are known to
   relate to the implementation or use of Status-Server.  This option
   differs from Status-Server because it is forwarded through proxies,
   so it can be sent to a RADIUS Server that does not have a direct
   connection to the Status-Realm RADIUS Client.  However, Access-
   Request packets are also forwarded, and there should be no additional
   attacks other than those incurred by forwarding Status-Realm-Request
   packets.

   Attacks on cryptographic hashes are well known [RFC4270] and getting
   better with time.  RADIUS uses the MD5 hash [RFC1321] for packet
   authentication and attribute obfuscation.  There are ongoing efforts
   in the IETF to analyze and address these issues for the RADIUS
   protocol.

   The Server-Information Attribute section describes a pair of sub-
   attributes to represent the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of a particular
   RADIUS server.  Vendors and operators should be aware that including
   this sub-attribute has the potential to divulge information about
   private networks, if the RADIUS server is accessible from outside the
   private network.  In the case where a RADIUS server lies behind a
   network translation and the operator desires to include the server-
   IP-Address or Server-IPv6-Address sub-attribute, the operator SHOULD
   configure the RADIUS Server to use the publicly routed IP address of
   the translation as the value of the sub-attribute.

   Security Considerations for Loop Prevention are TBD.
