      "body": "The Status-Realm packet probes a particular path, but the original client doesn't control which path.  Each proxy chooses a path to probe, and only the results for the chosen path are returned to the client.\n\nwe could conceivably allow for probing of multiple paths through one of two methods:\n\n1) an attribute \"avoid path\".  This would contain a list of Server-Identifiers taken from a Status-Realm-Response.  A proxy could then see if it's listed there, and if so, choose a _different_ next hop than what is listed.\n\n2) an attribute \"probe all paths\".  In which case a proxy would see this, and then send packets out all possible paths.  On the reply, it would need to merge the results back into one reply to the client.\n\nOption (1) seems simple.  Option (2) is more complex, because it allows for explosion of packets by sending 1.  And the only way to stop that explosion is to have some kind of globally unique packet identifier.  When there are multiple / overlapping paths, intermediate proxies would then have to track this identifier, and suppress sending the same thing again.\n\nOption (1) may leak a little bit of information about path A when a packet is sent over path B, but that's a small issue.",
